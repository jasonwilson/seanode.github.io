Welcome to Seattle Node.js! We are a group of Node.js enthusiasts and
technologists interested in event-based programming, highly-concurrent
applications, and bringing JavaScript to the server-side. We hope that you join
us and help the Node.js community continue to grow in Seattle.

Our official [Meetup]({{ site.author.meetup }}) page provides event
descriptions and reservations, while this site provides additional event
resources, slides, and discussions.
