Node.js - Stories from the Trenches

The Seattle Node.js Meetup is kicking things into gear in the new year with a panel of talks generally relating to running Node.js in production and with real world (e.g., security) challenges.

We are pleased to have Mixpo host the meetup in their brand new offices and provide us with pizza and beverages as we explore Node.js in the software and embedded environments.

As always, you can find all things Seattle Node.js-related at the group website:
[http://seanode.github.io/](http://seanode.github.io/). And you can reach out
to us via email [{{site.author.email}}](mailto:{{site.author.email}}) or Twitter
[@{{site.author.twitter}}](https://twitter.com/{{ site.author.twitter }}).

See you soon!
