The Seattle Node.js Meetup group's
[August 13th event](TODO_URL)
will have two great talks, leading us through the new world of
[Streams2](http://blog.nodejs.org/2012/12/20/streams2/) in Node.js v0.10 and
bring Node.js to digital radios. We are pleased to have Mixpo host the meetup
and provide us with pizza and beverages as we explore Node.js in the software
and embedded environments.

We will follow our talks with lightning talks. Anything interesting is game for
a talk! Be it a new GitHub project, a recent hacker event, or something cool
that you're working on. Feel free to post your ideas in the meetup page
comments, email us ahead of time, or just volunteer at the event.

As always, you can find all things Seattle Node.js-related at the group website:

to us via email [{{site.author.email}}](mailto:{{site.author.email}}) or Twitter

## Main Talks

### Node Streams2 Demystified

Bryce Baril will walk us through Streams2 as follows:

> If you're like me the first few times you tried to figure out node streams,
> you ended up confused and gave up because it was too difficult to understand.
> With streams2 that has all changed. I'll quickly walk through all you need to
> know about streams2 to see just how powerful and easy it is to use streams in
> your Node.js code.

Bryce is a total data nerd. You can usually find him in his basement writing
code while his [white standard poodle naps on the

One of the things he loves most is teaching his three daughters how to code.

Bryce also maintains the popular
[node_redis](https://github.com/mranney/node_redis) library.

### Creating Polymorphic Web Based Interfaces for Digital 2-Way Radio

John Hays' talk will cover:

> An overview of the UDR56k-4 radio project and how technologies such as
> websocket/node.js are enabling command, control, and communication to the
> radio from platform independent web interfaces.
