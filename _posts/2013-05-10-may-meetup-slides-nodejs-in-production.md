The Seattle Node.js Meetup's May 8th event had a great turnout and audience,
with over 90 folks finding their way to the [SURF Incubator][surf] to meet,
eat, and listen to talks. We want to again pass along a huge thanks to
[SURF][surf] for providing the venue and [MovingWorlds][mw] for bringing
the pizza and beverages.

## Node.js in Production

[Ryan Roemer](http://loose-bits.com) discussed some details and learning
experiences of running Node.js at Curiosity Media in his talk on
"**Node.js in Production**".

The slides are now available via:

* [GitHub Site](http://ryan-roemer.github.io/seanode-prod-talk/): The live,
  navigable [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) website.
  (Note: use space to advance slides and arrow keys to navigate).
* [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/RyanRoemer/seanode-prodtalk): More
  traditional format, with download (PDF) links.
