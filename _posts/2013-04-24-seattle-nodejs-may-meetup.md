The Seattle Node.js Meetup group is kicking things into gear with our next
event, scheduled for **Wednesday, May 8** and hosted downtown at the
[SURF Incubator][surf_loc]. We'll have pizza, beers, talks, and lightning
talks to get you socializing, listening, and talking about all things
Node.js.

We're also launching a new group website at
[http://seanode.github.io/](http://seanode.github.io/), hosted at our
GitHub [repository](https://github.com/seanode/seanode.github.io), for
additional articles, posts, and information from the local Node.js community.
And, we've started a new Twitter account,
[@{{site.author.twitter}}](https://twitter.com/{{ site.author.twitter }}),
which we hope you'll follow.
