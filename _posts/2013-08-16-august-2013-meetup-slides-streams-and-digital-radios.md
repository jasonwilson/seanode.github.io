The Seattle Node.js Meetup group's
[August 13th meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Node-js/events/131179222/)
took us through the Node.js core library with Streams2 and into the "real
world" of hardware with digital radios. [Mixpo](http://mixpo.com/) hosted the
event and provided us with tasty pizza and beverages. We also heard about
the [MoDevTablet](http://tablet13.gomodev.com/) conference in Seattle, now
underway.

And, now we've got the **slides** to share!

## Node Streams2 Demystified

[Bryce Baril](https://twitter.com/BryceBaril) of
[Ravenwall](https://ravenwall.com) took us through a tour of Node.js Streams2
(and even hinted at Streams3 coming next):

> If you're like me the first few times you tried to figure out node streams,
> you ended up confused and gave up because it was too difficult to understand.
> With streams2 that has all changed. I'll quickly walk through all you need to
> know about streams2 to see just how powerful and easy it is to use streams in
> your Node.js code.

His slides are now available at:

## Creating Polymorphic Web Based Interfaces for Digital 2-Way Radio

John Hays of [NW Digital Radio](http://nwdigitalradio.com) explored the use
of Node.js in digital radios:

> An overview of the UDR56k-4 radio project and how technologies such as
> websocket/node.js are enabling command, control, and communication to the
> radio from platform independent web interfaces.

John's slides are available at:

## See you next time!

We're already looking for topics and speakers for our next meetup. Some ideas
so far are Node.js security and error-handling / domains. Put your thinking
caps on and contact the organizers via email at
[{{site.author.email}}](mailto:{{site.author.email}}) or Twitter at
[@{{site.author.twitter}}](https://twitter.com/{{ site.author.twitter }}) to
suggest something or volunteer for a main or lightning talk!

As always, you can find all things Seattle Node.js-related at the group website:
