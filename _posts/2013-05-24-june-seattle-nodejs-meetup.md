The Seattle Node.js Meetup group's
[June 18th event](http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Node-js/events/89792012/)
will take us through a tour of writing and
packaging server appliances with Node.js, and the usual array of lightning
talks. We will have pizza, beers, beverages and all of the creative supplements
needed for an exciting night of Node.js learning and exploration.

We're still looking for more lightning talks. Everyone is welcome to come up
with an idea or presentation at the event, but please do consider throwing
something out there early for the group to discuss and refine before you present
it in the comments on this post or the
[meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Node-js/events/89792012/)!

As always, you can find all things Seattle Node.js-related at the group website:
[http://seanode.github.io/](http://seanode.github.io/). And you can reach out
to us via email [{{site.author.email}}](mailto:{{site.author.email}}) or Twitter
[@{{site.author.twitter}}](https://twitter.com/{{ site.author.twitter }}).

See you soon!

## Main Talk

Eugenio Pace is the cofounder of Auth0, an identity management service built
with Node.js. Before Auth0, he worked for Microsoft in various teams, and for
the last 5 years has worked mostly in cloud computing and identity engineering.

*Abstract*

> [Auth0](http://auth0.com/) is a server/service to drastically simplify
> authentication, identity federation and SSO scenarios. It's our first big
> project on node. One of the reasons we decided to build it entirely on Node.js,
> is the ability to package it and deploy it anywhere: as a service in the public
> cloud, as a virtual appliance on private cloud, or as an appliance on-premises.
> In this session we'll show how we built it, what worked well, what didn't, and
> the tools that we used.

## Venue / Sponsors

[Appature](http://www.appature.com/) has graciously agreed to host the event and
provide food and tasty beverages. Appature's offices are located at: 1633
Westlake Ave North, Suite 400, Seattle, WA
