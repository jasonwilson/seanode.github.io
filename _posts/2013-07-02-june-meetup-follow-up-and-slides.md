The Seattle Node.js Meetup group's
[June 18th event](http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Node-js/events/89792012/)
took us to [Appature](http://www.appature.com/)'s offices with a fantastic
evening view of Lake Union. We would like to thank Appature for not only
providing the venue, but offering great pizza, snacks and beer for the event.

## Building a Server Appliance with Node.js

[Eugenio Pace](http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Node-js/members/79227452/)
discussed his team's experiences building [Auth0](http://auth0.com/), an
identity management service, on Node.js.

Eugenio's slides are available at:
[http://seanode.github.io/assets/slides/pace-building-appliance-nodejs.pdf](/assets/slides/pace-building-appliance-nodejs.pdf)

And here's the talk the abstract again:

> [Auth0](http://auth0.com/) is a server/service to drastically simplify
> authentication, identity federation and SSO scenarios. It's our first big
> project on node. One of the reasons we decided to build it entirely on Node.js,
> is the ability to package it and deploy it anywhere: as a service in the public
> cloud, as a virtual appliance on private cloud, or as an appliance on-premises.
> In this session we'll show how we built it, what worked well, what didn't, and
> the tools that we used.

## Lightning Talks

We had two great lightning talks.

* [Alex Gounares](https://twitter.com/gounares) gave a talk on "Breakthrough
  Bottlenecks: Using Concurix's Analytics Tools for Faster Node.js Performance".
  Alex discussed [Concurix](http://www.concurix.com/)'s data and visual
  analytics tools that allow developers to achieve breakthrough software
  performance and use deep data analysis to accelerate performance in a
  many-core world. Concurix's Node.js product traces, visualizes, and pinpoints
  line-by-line software bottlenecks in Node.js server applications.

* [Bryce Baril](https://twitter.com/brycebaril) gave a rundown of the talks and
  happenings from May's [NodePDX](http://nodepdx.org/) Node.js conference in
  Portland.

## Next Event - Let's Get Going!

We are looking for topics / speakers for our next meetup event. One suggestion
so far is a talk on error-handling and domains. Others are most welcome too!
Please reach out to the organizers via email at
[{{site.author.email}}](mailto:{{site.author.email}}) or Twitter at
[@{{site.author.twitter}}](https://twitter.com/{{ site.author.twitter }}) to
suggest something or volunteer for a main or lightning talk!

As always, you can find all things Seattle Node.js-related at the group website:
