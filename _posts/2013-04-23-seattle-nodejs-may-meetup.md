## Venue

The [SURF Incubator][surf] is located in the Exchange building at:
821 Second Ave., Suite 800, Seattle, WA 98104. See their [location][surf_loc]
page for additional details. The Exchange building closes at 6:00pm, so we will

the presentations. Please message the meetup page if you are having any
difficulties getting in.
